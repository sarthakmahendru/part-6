    <h2 id="p1">Chapter 1: A Pup Named Liza</h2>
    <p id="ps1">
        Liza was born on a chilly morning in an empty backyard, her fur golden like the first rays of sunrise. A family adopted her when she was barely old enough to open her eyes. They gave her squeaky toys, messy meals, and the warmth of a soft couch where she curled up after chasing shadows all day.
        <br><br>
        She followed the children around the garden, napping in flowerbeds and licking paint off their fingers during arts and crafts. Liza grew with love stitched into every moment. When the family whispered “forever” into her ears, she believed them.
        <br><br>
        But seasons change. Boxes replaced photo frames, and one morning, the laughter left with a closing door. Liza was locked inside the storage room with her bed, a bowl, and a silence she didn’t understand.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p2">Chapter 2: The Forgotten Room</h2>
    <p id="ps2">
        Days blurred. Hunger gnawed at her belly, and she scratched the door until her paws bled. No one came. Liza began to count the cracks in the wall, waiting for footsteps that never returned. She whimpered less, barked less, and the light behind her eyes dimmed.
        <br><br>
        A new man bought the house—not cruel, just indifferent. When he saw Liza, he muttered something about “not his problem” and locked the same door again. That room became her whole world: a faded mattress, a broken window with shadows that danced but never spoke.
        <br><br>
        Only one person noticed. A neighbor, quiet and kind, slipped food through a gap and whispered soft words each evening. Liza didn't know her name, but she knew hope had a scent—warm, like chapati and kindness.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p3">Chapter 3: The Door Opens</h2>    
    <p id="ps3">
        One afternoon, thunder rolled—not from the sky, but from voices outside. A group arrived with flashlights and clipped steps, led by a woman with sharp eyes and gentle hands. The door creaked open, and for a moment, Liza shrank back into her corner.
        <br><br>
        But the woman crouched, her palm open like a promise. “You’re safe now,” she said, and something inside Liza stirred—an old memory of being held. She walked out slowly, uncertain, and was wrapped in a blanket and cradled like someone precious.
        <br><br>
        They drove through the night, past city lights and open fields. For the first time in months, Liza saw stars again. She pressed her nose to the window, wondering how far away love could be… and if it could follow.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p4">Chapter 4: Panic and Petals</h2>
    <p id="ps4">
        Her new life had sunshine and space, other rescued animals, and quiet laughter. But every time someone grabbed keys or shoes, Liza began to tremble. Closed doors sent her into spirals. She barked at empty rooms, afraid they would forget her too.
        <br><br>
        She chewed blankets, refused food, and slept curled against the front gate—terrified it would swing open and leave her behind. The woman tried everything: treats, walks, lullabies. Still, trust wouldn’t grow where fear had dug deep roots.
        <br><br>
        Then, one morning, the woman sat beside Liza in the garden and never left. All day, she hummed songs and fed her gently from her hand. Liza didn’t panic when the sun set. She just blinked, tired… and stayed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p5">Chapter 5: Healing in Bloom</h2>
    <p id="ps5">
        It began in small ways. Liza started wagging when she saw the gate open. She trotted behind the woman instead of hiding in corners. Doors became just objects—not curses. She wore a little scarf during walks and stood tall when strangers passed.
        <br><br>
        At the shelter, she became the dog that greeted newcomers, nudging shy puppies out of fear and into play. She'd sleep without twitching now, often snoring while curled near the fireplace. Her tail told stories before her mouth could bark.
        <br><br>
        One spring morning, the woman opened the door and called, “Come on, Liza.” No fear, no hesitation. The golden dog leapt forward into the sun, chasing butterflies again—like a pup in a backyard long ago. This time, she knew: no one was leaving without her.

    <h2 id="p21">Chapter 1: Into the Silence</h2>
    <p id="ps21">
        The husky had no name when he was abandoned. His fur shimmered silver beneath the moon, and his eyes held the glint of loyalty that hadn’t yet shattered. The car door had closed without warning. Then tires rolled away, and the forest swallowed everything else.
        <br><br>
        He wandered through towering trees and jagged rocks, calling out in whimpers that echoed across hollow valleys. Birds flew from branches at his cries, and the trail of human scent faded with each rainfall. Hunger, confusion, and fading hope became his only companions
        <br><br>
        But instincts awakened. He hunted with caution, drank from cold streams, and slept beneath broken skies. The wilderness accepted him—not with warmth, but with indifference. Days stretched into seasons, and survival became the only name he knew
    </p>
    <h2 id="p22">Chapter 2: The Day Vision Faded</h2>
    <p id="ps22">
        One morning, the husky chased a rustle into a thorn thicket. A sudden flash—claws, a growl, and burning pain. He escaped the wildcat’s claws, but his eyes burned long after the fight. At first, the world became blurry. Then it dimmed. Then it vanished.
        <br><br>
        He howled into the dark—not at the sky, but at something inside him breaking. Branches no longer had edges; light no longer had color. The jungle became a map of sound and scent, and he followed it like a fragile thread woven through night
        <br><br>
        He began listening to wind shifts, memorizing the way moss grew on bark, feeling the earth tremble beneath squirrel paws. The blindness made him slower—but not weaker. He was still alive. And somewhere deep inside, he still believed someone might come.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p23">Chapter 3: Whispers Between Trees</h2>
    <p id="ps23">
        The husky grew lean and quiet. He stopped chasing birds and learned instead to sit still and feel the world move. A stream became his guide. He learned its bends, its icy plunge, its patterns during storms. It gave water—and direction
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, voices would echo through the woods: hikers laughing, a child crying, a dog barking far away. He’d follow the sounds but never get close enough. The jungle was vast, and the fear of humans—burned into memory—kept him cautious.
        <br><br>
        Then one evening, while curled in his usual hollow beneath a ridge, he heard slow steps—not hurried, not loud. And a voice—low, kind, humming something not meant for ears, but for comfort. That voice didn’t come with footsteps of urgency or boots of anger. It paused.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p24">Chapter 4: The Rescue Without Sight</h2>
    <p id="ps24">
        The woman spoke gently. She didn’t know who was listening, only that someone was. She left food in the open, then sat beside it—not too close. The husky waited for her to leave, but she didn’t. She just stayed and let the forest breathe around them both.
        <br><br>
        The next day, she returned. Then again. Eventually, he approached—not boldly, not trustingly, just near enough to feel her presence. When she whispered “It’s okay now,” the jungle didn’t fall silent, but something inside him did. For the first time, he rested beside a human.
        <br><br>
        She led him out with soft taps on the ground and the sound of her humming. It wasn’t easy. Rain slowed them. Mud swallowed their steps. But the husky never looked back—because he couldn’t. He just listened and followed the music of a voice that didn’t disappear.
    </p>
    <h2 id="p25">Chapter 5: Home in the Lightless Place</h2>
    <p id="ps25">
        He now lives in a quiet shelter surrounded by other rescued animals. He doesn't chase balls or run through fields. Instead, he listens for birds he cannot see, and leans against the woman whenever the wind reminds him of old pain
        <br><br>
        She placed wind chimes around his bed, each tone tuned to a different emotion: calm, joy, safety. When he gets scared, she rings one that means "I’m here." And slowly, he stopped trembling when doors opened or footsteps passed.
        <br><br>
        People say he’s broken. But they’re wrong. He’s proof that some journeys don’t need eyes—just heart, memory, and the sound of kindness echoing through trees. When he sleeps now, he doesn’t dream of the jungle. He dreams of wind chimes and the voice that found him in the wild.
